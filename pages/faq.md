### **FAQ**

Does the application read all my messages?
No only messages SMSes coming in from unknown contacts and contacts that you have not have conversed with are handed over to Scamshield by the operating system

Are the messages stored?
Only SMSes that the system is confident is a spam or scam =>80% are automatically reported and sent to SPF. This helps us to aggregate reports and identify offenders to quickly take action on

What is stored when its automatically reported?
We only store the SMS message and the source number. We do not store any other data and there are no identifiers to trace back to individuals

How do you determine which numbers to block?
Blocking is done by SPF when they have deemed or have information that a number has been used in illegal activities
