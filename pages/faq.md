**Frequently asked question**

**Will the app block calls from people I know?**

No. The app only blocks calls from our database of blocked numbers, managed centrally by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and Singapore Police Force (SPF).

**Will it filter SMSes from people I know?**

The app does not operate on messages coming from people already in your contact list.

**Will I still be able to see the SMSes that have been filtered?**

Yes. A junk SMS folder will be created on your phone. It is the same concept as a junk folder for your email inbox. You will be able to see those messages, if you should choose.

**Are there any privacy concerns with using the app?**

The app does not read any data from people in your contact list. Only messages sent by unknown persons will be read by the AI. The app also does not have any access to your location data or any personal data (because it&#39;s not necessary!)

**What happens if I delete the app? Will all my junk messages be deleted too?**

No, the app cannot delete your messages. If you delete the app, the junk SMS folder on your phone will also be deleted and the junk messages will go back to your original SMS folder.

**When will the Android version be out? I want this app on my phone!**

We are working with the developers to develop and roll out an Android version. We will let you know as soon as it is ready.

**Who built this app?**

The app is a collaboration between the National Crime Prevention Council, Open Government Products team (OGP) at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and SPF.

**Once installed, can hackers hack into my phone if the app is compromised?**

As the app does not individually identify any users, and it does not access any other data on your phone, you and your phone are not at risk if the app is compromised.

**How does ScamShield works?**

The mobile app filters through incoming calls and text messages, and compares them against your contact list. It will screen calls or messages not in the list and compares that against the database. If it is a scam call, it will be automatically blocked. If it is a scam message, it will automatically be filtered to a junk SMS folder.

Only calls and messages classified as scam will be sent for collation. This is to allow the app to remain updated and will also help protect others from such scam call and messages.

**Why should I download ScamShield?**

Why not? Currently, no telcos can help you filter spam calls and text messages. ScamShield mobile app is free to download and most importantly it helps you to filter spam calls and text messages.

**How do I set up the app for the first time?**

You can find our app to download in the App Store if you search for &quot;ScamShield.&quot; Or tap here if you are on your phone to install.

**Do I need a Wi-Fi or data plan for the app to work?**

No, you don&#39;t need Wi-Fi or data plan for the app to work. The app will run on the background to filter through incoming calls and text messages.

However, without a Wi-Fi or data plan, the app will be unable to send details of the scam messages and numbers for collation.

**Will the app block calls from people I know?**

No. The app only blocks calls from our database of blocked numbers.

**Will it filter SMSes from people I know?**

The app does not operate on messages coming from people already in your contact list.

**Will I still be able to see the SMSes that have been filtered?**

Yes. A junk SMS folder will be created on your phone. It is the same concept as a junk folder for your email inbox. You will be able to see those messages, if you should choose.

**Will the app be able to filter spam messages from WhatsApp?**

No, the app can only filter incoming SMSes. If you received spam messages from other chat apps such as WhatsApp, Wechat, IMO, Viber, etc, you can forward the spam messages via in-app reporting function. Alternatively, you can forward the spam messages to +65-82410342. Standard text messages apply for each SMS.

**Can I inactivate either the filtering of incoming phone calls or text messages function?**

No, the app is programmed to filter both incoming calls and SMSes.

**I have questions about the app! Who can I ask?**
