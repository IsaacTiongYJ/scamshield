![Scamshield protecting you from scam](/images/Illustration-splash-hero.png)

Scamshield protects you in two ways. We have developed a custom machine learning algorithm that works **on your device** which will intercept SMSes coming from unknown contacts to determine if its a potential scam. If the algorithm determines the incoming SMS to be a scam it will be moved to a filtered or Junk folder on your device.

**Would Scamshield be reading all my messages?**
Nope, iOS has strict privacy rules on what Scamshield can or cannot read. If a message comes from a known contact, iOS will not pass the SMS to Scamshield. If you have previously interacted with an unknown contact or decided to engage an unknown contact in conversation then Scamshield will not get to see the message either.
