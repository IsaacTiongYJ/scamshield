Scamshield protects you by blocking away calls and SMSes that originate from scammers. 

We block calls from known scammers by working with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in determining what numbers to block.  

Scamshield retrieves this list from SPF periodically and stores it on your device. When you receive a phone call, Scamshield checks if the incoming call is on the list and actively blocks it from reaching you.

For incoming SMSes, Scamshield can only access SMSes if it fulfils requirements set out by Apple iOS. The SMS must originate from an unknown contact and that the user has not interacted with that number before. 

For SMSes that are passed to Scamshield, Scamshield utilises its on-device algorithm to determine if the SMS is a potential scam message. If the algorithm determines the incoming SMS to be a scam it will move it to a filtered or Junk folder on your device.

**Would Scamshield be reading all my messages?**
Nope, iOS has strict privacy rules on what Scamshield can or cannot read. If a message comes from a known contact, iOS will not pass the SMS to Scamshield. If you have previously interacted with an unknown contact or decided to engage an unknown contact in conversation then Scamshield will not get to see the message either.
