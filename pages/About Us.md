## What is ScamShield?
ScamShield is an anti-scam product developed by the National Crime Prevention Council and Open Government Products. 

## Features

The ScamShield mobile app has 3 main features:Â 
* Automatically Blocks scam calls
* Automatically Detects scam messages 
* Users can Report scam messages and calls

## How it works

The ScamShield app checks incoming calls and text messages. An incoming call from an unknown caller is checked against our database to determine if the number has been used for scams and blocks it.

When you receive an incoming SMS from an unknown contact, ScamShield will determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm. For iOS, it filters the messages to a junk SMS folder. For Android, a notification is sent to users to notify them that a scam message has been received.

Detected and reported scams are sent to NCPC and SPF for collation. This keeps the app updated and will help protect others from such scam calls and messages.

ScamShield does not collect any personal information from the user.
