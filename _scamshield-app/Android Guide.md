#### How can I tell if ScamShield is working on my Android phone?
<img style="width:90%" alt="<ScamShield sending a push notification on an Android phone>" src="/images/android%20notification.png">


*   When you receive a scam SMS from an **unknown number**, you will receive a **push notificatio**n from ScamShield informing you that it is a scam message.
*   When ScamShield detects a scam message, you don't need to report it as we have already reported it to the authorities to ensure your safety.
*   ScamShield also works in the background silently to block scam calls.


#### What should I report to ScamShield?

*   To help us protect you better, report any scams that we may have missed detecting.


#### How does it work on my Android phone?
*   The app filters incoming calls and SMSes from **unknown numbers, including overseas numbers.** ScamShield uses a combination of an on-device algorithm and information provided by the Singapore Police Force (SPF), such as blacklisted numbers linked to scams, to determine if a call or SMS is a scam.

*   When you receive an SMS from an unknown number, ScamShield will determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm. 
*   For Android users, you will receive a  notification from ScamShield informing you that the app has detected a scam message.


#### Your privacy is important to us

*   For your privacy, ScamShield **does not filter calls and SMSes from contacts that you have saved on your phone.**
